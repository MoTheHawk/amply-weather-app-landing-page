## Design Variation #1: Taking Advantage of Available Info and Assets
In this case study, the actual name of the app and what it looks like were never outlined, but if they were, I would have been inclined to incorporate them into the design. If the app has a logo, I would have included this somewhere near the top of the content box as well. Otherwise, referencing the name of the app in the header text instead of just "the app" would suffice. I also would have completetly replaced the weather display widget with a mockup of a screenshot of the app with a Samsung Galaxy S10 shell around it, accompanied by a bullet point feature list. Showing users exactly what experience they'll be getting instead of just an approximation of it might create more confidence in choosing to download.

## Design Variation #2: More Weather Data and Allowing Users to Customize It
This would probably be overbearing and unnecessary for the 65+ demographic, but it's at least worth considering; users could potentially be "wowed" by the depth of the available data and the ability to customize how their daily reports would look. Depending on how much extra vertical space would be occupied to accomodate this, however, the CTA may need to be moved above the weather widget so it doesn't get lost below the fold.

## Design Variation #3: Default Google Play Store Button instead of Custom CTA Button
This is a commonly-accepted web standard and could potentially drive even more conversion if the users are more familiar with that specific button for downloading apps.
